Self-quarantine makes people go insane, and my version of insanity is going to GitHub and starting a site. As someone who recently quitted her job, made a brave (maybe dumb) move to a new country that requires 2 weeks of self-isolation, this might not be the worst.

I have been taking in knowledge and information for my whole life, the urge of sharing, getting out what I have learned is growing stronger and stronger. Since I don't have audience, nor do I intend to go out of my way to seek one, I am using this site as a place for journaling, with some sensitivity in mind (it's still public). Any communications are very welcome, if you happen to bump into my articles. 

Okay, let's get started.
